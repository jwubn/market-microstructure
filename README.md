# Market microstruture analysis

"Market microstructure is a branch of finance concerned with the details of how exchange occurs in markets. While the theory of market microstructure applies to the exchange of real or financial assets, more evidence is available on the microstructure of financial markets due to the availability of transactions data from them. The major thrust of market microstructure research examines the ways in which the working processes of a market affect determinants of transaction costs, prices, quotes, volume, and trading behavior. In the twenty-first century, innovations have allowed an expansion into the study of the impact of market microstructure on the incidence of market abuse, such as insider trading, market manipulation and broker-client conflict." -- Wikipedia

Two topics research related to market microstructure and their implementation codes are provided here.

Assignment 2 is the analysis of response function, which can be used to callibrate the market impact generated by transactions.

Assignment 3 is the analysis of imbalance-return relationship. To be transparent, I took the course in earlier this year and I totally forget what this term means. Yet, I still put my assignment codes here just in case.
